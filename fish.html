                Fish are an important source of food.  Fish provide 20 percent of animal protein to about 3 billion people.

                <h2>Role of Fish in the Eco System</h2>
                <p>
                    Fish make a major contribution to their
                    ecosystem: providing essential nutrients that support the whole
                    ecosystem. Simply put, fish are excellent recyclers of the nutrients that algae and other bottom-level species need to survive that
                    in turn support the remainder of the ecosystem. The importance of
                    this function suggests that overfishing can be highly detrimental to
                    the proper functioning of the whole ecosystem

                <h2>Prevent Water Pollution</h2>
                <p>
                    Whether you are by a body of water or farther inland, chemicals and pollutants linked to human activity make their way to the ocean. Helpful actions include properly disposing
                    of waste or recyclables and reducing or eliminating lawn and garden fertilization. Plastic debris in
                    waters is a big problem for fishâ€”ingestion and entanglement are among the problems. Actions such
                    as joining or organizing a beach or river cleanup, switching to reusable plastic bags, and reducing
                    plastic consumption overall can help prevent and reduce the risk to fish and other marine life
