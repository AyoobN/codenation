                Despite their exalted status and relative lack of natural predators, pandas are still at risk. Severe threats from humans have left just over 1,800 pandas in the wild.

                <h2>Importance of Panda's</h2>
                <p>
                    Giant pandas help to keep their mountain forests healthy by spreading seeds in their droppings, which helps vegetation to thrive.

                    The panda’s forest environment is also important for local people – for food, income and fuel for cooking and heating. Giant pandas live in the mountain catchment areas of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers, whose river basins are the economic heart of China, home to over half a billion people.

                <h2>Reduce Travel Impact</h2>
                <p>
                    Climate change endangers animal species by destroying their habitats and wiping out their food sources. If you travel on transports that emit greenhouse gasses, you contribute to global warming. Walk instead of taking your car or public transport whenever possible. Carpooling, video conferencing and choosing airlines with higher occupancy rates and more efficient aircraft go a long way to reducing travel impacts.
